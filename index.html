    <p>In measuring a country’s response to a problem, one significant indicator lies in the language used by the media to discuss it. In 2018, Puerto Rico hardly acknowledged femicides, but today, the term 'femicide' is gaining prominence as a critical sociological concept, shedding light on the gender-based violence that plagues the nation.</p>
    <p>The term ‘femicide’ first surfaced in the English-speaking world in 1976, emphasizing the political implications of women being murdered by men. It was later coined by Mexican politician Marcela Lagarde in 2005 when investigating the murders of women in Ciudad Juárez. Though the term found frequent use in Latin American countries, the Puerto Rican media used to describe women’s killings based on the methods used—poisoning, firearm use, blows, or burns—. The underlying gender motivations in these murders, that women were targeted merely for being women, often went unaddressed.</p>
    <p>In the past five years, the frequency of the term ‘femicide’ —feminicidio in Spanish— in media reports has surged. This change in language reflects the growing awareness surrounding gender violence and the necessity for preventive measures.</p>
    <p>Graphs depicting the increase in ‘'femicide’ mentions in headlines and leads of major newspapers, NotiCel and El Vocero, offer a visual testament to this shifting discourse. The reports not only address specific femicides but also delve into the broader issue, advocating for care and prevention strategies.</p>

    </script>
        <p>However, this transformation in media language has not occurred in isolation. The feminist movement in Puerto Rico has been steadily gaining strength from multiple fronts over these five years.</p>
    <p>The catalyst for this amplified focus on gender violence came on November 23, 2018, when hundreds of protesters, led by the political organization Colectiva Feminista en Construcción, gathered outside La Fortaleza, then the residence of Governor Ricardo Rosselló. Their demands included the signing of an executive order declaring a state of emergency in response to the country’s gender violence crisis.</p>

          <p>On November 23, 2018, hundreds of protesters led by the political organization Colectiva Feminista en Construcción stood in front of La Fortaleza, the home of Puerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rosselló at the time. </p>
          <p>They demanded the signing of an executive order to declare a state of emergency due to the crisis of gender violence in the country.</p> 
          <p>A little over a year had passed since Hurricane María, which struck the archipelago on September 20, 201, and 23 women had been murdered by their partners or ex-partners. A significant increase with those registered in previous years, but that could not be specified because the statistics collected by the government were not reliable.</p>
          <p>One of the claims of the state of emergency was the development of a standardized and uniform statistics collection system, with the purpose that the country would have uniform statistics.</p>

        <div class="step" data-image="url(images/foto3.png)" data-background-position="center center">
          <p>The organizations Proyecto Matria and Kilómetro 0 released on the study The persistence of indolence: femicides in Puerto Rico 2014-2018. The study uses as part of its methodology the definition of the European Institute for Gender Equality.</p>
          <p><i>“The killing of a woman by an intimate partner and the death of a woman as a result of a practice that is harmful to women. Intimate partner is understood as a former or current spouse or partner, whether or not the perpetrator shares or has shared the same residence with the victim.”</i></p>
          <p>In addition to intimate partners, under the concept of femicide they included women murdered by unknown persons. The definition makes it possible to excuse any matter related to the intentionality of the action that caused the death of the woman.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step" data-image="url(images/foto4.png)">
          <p>In March 2020, several feminist organizations came together to create the Puerto Rico Gender Equality Observatory, a civil response to the lack of reliable official statistics. The Observatory uses the Latin American Model Protocol for the investigation of gender-related killings of women.</p>

          <p>The Observatory issues monthly statistical reports that the country's press reports with their definitions.</p>

          <p>Governor Pedro Pierluisi, at the beginning of his term, in January 2021, declared a state of emergency due to gender violence in Puerto Rico. He acknowledges that “for too long, vulnerable victims have suffered the consequences of systematic machismo, inequality, discrimination, lack of education, lack of guidance and above all, lack of action”.</p>
          <p>The Puerto Rico Legislature approved a project that the governor signed into law on August 27, 2021 to recognize and establish femicide and transfemicide as behaviors that constitute the crime of first degree murder.</p>

    <p>Experts and women’s rights advocates expect that the change in language signifies the evolving consciousness of Puerto Rico’s society and the determination to combat gender-based violence through unified action and data-driven strategies.</p>
  <p><i><strong>Methodology:</strong></i></p> 
                <p><i>I scraped two news websites, <p><i><a href=https://www.elvocero.com>El Vocero</a> and <a href=https://www.noticel.com/>NotiCel</a>. For both, I used BeautifulSoup on their search engines to identify all the articles that showed as results when typing the word “feminicidio”. After having scraped, I created a DataFrame for each one to filter how many times the word “feminicidio” was used in a headline or in the preview of the content that shows up in the results page. I used Datawrapper for the chart and Scrollama for the timeline. The typing effect on the headline was created using Javascript.
